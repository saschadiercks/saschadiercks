# HI, I'm Sascha

I'm Senior Fronted Developer bei DÃ¤nisches Bettenlager / JYSK.
My profession is to build desireable and converting frontends.

I've also developed a foundation in UX, UI and CRO. I've lead a team to improve the conversion rate.

I've already build a Design System / Framework based on BEM and ITCSS because I like handcrafted solutions instead of the one size fits some solution.

## Let me tell your about my workflow

I've bin working in e-commerce since 2000 and I've taken care of the whole process.
From conception to coordination with several teams, develeopment (of course) and optimization.
