# Hi, I'm Sascha
  I'm Senior Fronted Developer at DÃ¤nisches Bettenlager / JYSK.
  My profession is to build fast, desireable and converting frontends.

  I've also developed a foundation in UX, UI and CRO. I've lead a team to improve the conversion rate.

  I've already build a Design System / Framework based on BEM and ITCSS because I like handcrafted solutions instead of the "one size fits some" solution.

  ## Let me tell your about my workflow

  I've beenn working in e-commerce since 2000 and I've taken care of the whole process:
  from conception to coordination with several teams, develeopment (of course) and optimization.
